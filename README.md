# Starbucks UI

This project is a remake of the Starbucks mobile payment app, which was released in 2011. The app allowed users to load their Starbucks card credit to their iPhones and make payements from special scanners at each store.

The project focuses on the use of object-oriented **design patterns** to build the app from scratch. Instead of using pre-existing app development frameworks, a simple visual arts framework, [Processing](https://processing.org/) along with [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) is used.

Java is used to design and build the unit components of any app development framework. Some key components implemented include:
- Device
- Frame
- App Controller
- Screen
- Nav Bar
- Tab View
- List View
- Keypad
- Button
